# Combat Evaluator Notes

Some buffs change the effective stats for every hit while others either have a chance to activate or change values on each hit. Empiracle analysis is possible, but I'm sure I can find a better method.

Most all the buffs that ALWAYS add to stats are included already. But some work in other ways.

Base Stat Modifiers
These are the easiest to implement
- [DONE] Terrorize: -0.1% per point to enemy Damage
- [DONE] Super Elite Slayer: +0.2% per point reduction to Super Elite Creature Damage, Attack, Defense and Armor
- [DONE] Holy Flame: +0.2% per point to Damage vs. Undead
- [DONE] Anchored: +0.05% per point Damage is added to HP during combat
- [DONE] Chi strike: 0.1% per point of your HP is added to your Damage during combat
- [DONE] Death Dealer: +0.01% extra Damage per point per 5 Creature kills in a row without dying (Max 20%)
- [DONE] Dark Curse: +0.2% reduction per point to enemy Defense
- [DONE] Counter Attack: +0.25% per point to Attack and Damage at the cost of +0.25% per point Stamina (PvE only, casting level can be adjusted from your Preferences)
